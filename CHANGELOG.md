# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project follows
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html). As of v1.0.0 the exported
surface is frozen: additions ship as v1.x; any breaking change ships under a new major
module path (`.../v2`) and is called out under **Changed**/**Removed**.

## [Unreleased]

## [v2.0.0-alpha] — 2026-06-11 — editable input + live formatting

v2 makes the same widget an **opt-in light editor**: a host can let a user type or paste
data and watch it pretty-format live. Read-only hosts migrate by changing only the import
path — see [MIGRATION.md](MIGRATION.md). The exported surface is re-frozen as the **/v2**
surface (`TestExportedSurfaceGolden`); a future breaking change ships under `.../v3`.

### Changed (breaking)
- **Module path** bumped to `github.com/ideaconnect/go-fyne-pretty-view/v2` (Go semantic
  import versioning). This is the only breaking change: **no v1 symbol was renamed or had
  its semantics changed.** Read-only ergonomics (`New`, `NewWithData`, `SetData`/`SetText`,
  `Source`, `Reparse`, `Format`, all `With*`) are preserved with v1 semantics.

### Added
- **Edit mode (opt-in, construction-time):** `WithEditable()` + `Editable() bool`. The
  input-vs-output purpose is fixed at construction — there is no `SetEditable` and no
  chrome toggle (a host-only runtime flip is deferred, see issue #54). A rendered caret,
  character input, Enter/arrows/Home/End, and selection editing.
- **Live formatting:** `InputConfig{ DebounceFor, AutoFormat, MaxEditBytes }` +
  `AutoFormatMode` (`AutoFormatOff`/`AutoFormatOnPause`/`AutoFormatOnBlur`),
  `WithInputConfig`/`SetInputConfig`, and `Reformat()`. On a debounced pause (or an
  explicit `Reformat`) the buffer is re-parsed into the structured, syntax-colored view;
  the caret is anchored across the reformat by its byte offset.
- **`Text() string`** — the document as displayed (pretty), distinct from the raw
  `Source()` bytes; `Source()`/`Reparse` read the live edit buffer in edit mode.
- **Caret API:** `Caret() (line, col int)`, `SetCaret(line, col int) bool`.
- **Undo/redo:** `Undo()`, `Redo()`, `WithUndoLimit(n)` (word-coalesced, bounded).
- **Clipboard:** `Cut()`, `Paste()` (control-byte-safe, one undo unit).
- **Validation feedback:** `ParseStatus{ OK, ErrorLine }`, `ParseStatus()`,
  `SetOnValidationChanged`, and an error-tinted gutter marker.
- **`SetOnChanged(func(string))`** — fired (debounced) after the edited text settles.

## [v1.1.0-alpha] — 2026-06-11

### Added
- The built-in toolbar and search-bar icon controls now carry **hover tooltips** (via
  [fyne-tooltip](https://github.com/dweymouth/fyne-tooltip)) — e.g. *Find next*,
  *Previous match*, *Case-sensitive*, *Regular expression*, *Open file…*, *Expand all*,
  *Collapse all*, *Toggle soft-wrap*. Tooltips render when the host wraps its window in
  `fynetooltip.AddWindowToolTipLayer(content, canvas)` (the demo does this); they are
  absent, not an error, without it. Additive and backward-compatible (the control
  constructors still return `fyne.CanvasObject`).

## [v1.0.0-alpha] — 2026-06-11 — frozen public surface

The exported API of `prettyview` and `fonttheme` is declared stable as of v1.0.0 and
guarded by `TestExportedSurfaceGolden`; see the README **Stability** section. After
1.0 a breaking change ships under a new major module path (`.../v2`).

### Changed (breaking)
- `Match` now uses `int` for all columns (`Line` was `int32`), and
  `PrettyView.Matches() []Match` returns a snapshot of the current hits.
- `WithSearchConfig` merges field-by-field over the defaults: a zero field keeps its
  default, removing the `DebounceFor: 0` zero-value trap. A negative `DebounceFor`
  disables keystroke coalescing.
- `DefaultToolbarConfig(win fyne.Window)` takes the window, so it truly enables every
  control (`nil` omits Open and Ctrl/Cmd+F).

### Added
- A frozen exported-surface golden test (`testdata/api_surface.txt`) and a
  **Stability** section in the README and both package docs.

### Fixed
- Search bar: pressing Enter (find-next) repeatedly now advances through every match
  (1→2→3→…, wrapping) instead of always snapping back to match #2.
- Search bar: the leading magnifier renders at button size and padding (aligned with
  the control row) instead of as a small bare icon.

### Documentation
- Pinned the `Search` (immediate) vs `SearchDebounced` (coalescing) contract and the
  `SearchMode` constants; `Source()` notes that its slice aliases the retained buffer.

## [v0.9.0-alpha] — 2026-06-11 — feature-complete + freeze candidate

### Added
- `ScrollToLine(line) bool`, `ScrollOffset()`, and `SetScrollOffset(pos)` — a
  format-independent programmatic scroll / go-to-line API and scroll-position
  save/restore.
- `CollapseToDepth(d)` / `ExpandToDepth(d)` — runtime fold-to-depth on `PrettyView`
  and `Document`.
- `WithLineNumbers()` — an opt-in line-number gutter (numbers drawn from the model,
  no per-line widgets).
- Right-click **Copy key path** (JSON/JSONC) — the clicked node's JSONPath accessor,
  e.g. `$.users[1].name`.
- Keyboard selection and fold control: `Shift`+arrows / `Shift`+`Home`/`End` extend a
  selection from the caret, `Enter` toggles the caret line's fold, `Left`/`Right`
  scroll horizontally.
- `example_test.go` (rendered on pkg.go.dev), `CHANGELOG.md`, and `SECURITY.md`;
  release archives now ship a `SHA256SUMS` manifest.

### Changed
- `CopySubtree(byteOffset)` and `ExpandTo(byteOffset)` now resolve nodes for **XML and
  HTML** too (real per-node source byte offsets are populated), not JSON/JSONC only.

## [v0.5.0-alpha] — parser hardening + chrome parity

### Added
- `FuzzParse` native fuzz target across all formats (run in CI), plus a govulncheck
  gate in CI and the release workflow.
- Search bar: case-sensitive (`Aa`) and regex (`.*`) toggles, Shift+Enter (find
  previous), Esc (clear); the counter shows `bad regex` for an invalid pattern.
- Public `SearchDebounced(q)` (coalescing scan) and `SearchError() error`.
- Right-click **Copy subtree** for the node under the cursor — works for every format.
- `WithMaxInputBytes(n)` caps `SetData`/`SetText` input.
- JSONC `//` and `/* */` comments now render as nodes (visible, searchable, copyable).

### Fixed
- Control-byte leaks into display lines (XML/HTML text and tag/attribute names) found
  by fuzzing; a `recover()` boundary degrades a parser panic to the raw fallback;
  HTML nesting depth is bounded; the file-open dialog surfaces picker errors instead
  of swallowing them.

### Security
- Bumped `golang.org/x/image` to v0.41.0, clearing the last reachable CVEs;
  `govulncheck ./...` reports no vulnerabilities.

## [v0.4.0-alpha] — honor the invariants under load

### Changed
- Search match-highlight rectangles are culled to the horizontal visible window —
  per-reflow rect count is O(visible columns), not O(matches).
- A byte==column-grid fast path makes a reflow deep into a huge/soft-wrapped line
  O(visible window), not O(scroll position) (a 2 MB line: ~16 ms → ~1.4 ms).
- Regex search gained a literal-prefix prefilter; performance/model-size docs were
  re-scoped to measured numbers (plain scan ~5 ms; model ~4.85×–7.1× source).

### Added
- Renderer-attached perf/alloc regression guards and a benchmark smoke step in CI.

## [v0.3.0-alpha] — stop silently dropping or misrepresenting input

### Fixed
- JSON auto-detect requires a plausible token after a leading bracket (log/markdown
  lines no longer mis-parse as JSON); trailing content after a JSON root falls back to
  raw (NDJSON stays visible); raw control bytes in segments are C-escaped; a search
  match on a collapsed fold-head is now highlighted.

### Changed
- `ExpandTo` and `CopySubtree` return `bool` and are documented JSON/JSONC-only;
  `CopySubtree` copies the pretty-printed rendering.

### Security
- Toolchain bumped to go 1.26.4, clearing two stdlib CVEs.

## [v0.2.0-alpha] — fonts, icons, parser/search hardening

### Added
- Opt-in `fonttheme` subpackage bundling JetBrains Mono + Inter (SIL OFL 1.1).
- Toolbar icons switched to Font Awesome Free (CC BY 4.0).

### Fixed
- Parser robustness across JSON/XML/HTML detection and recovery; a regex-search anchor
  regression (`^`, `\b`, `\B`) where re-slicing re-anchored the pattern.

## [v0.1.0-alpha] — initial alpha

- First public alpha of the virtualized JSON/JSONC/XML/HTML/raw viewer widget:
  syntax highlighting, folding with collapse summaries, char-level selection and copy,
  search with reveal-into-folds, optional soft-wrap, and an opt-in toolbar — built to
  a hard memory budget (only viewport-many rows are ever live widgets).
